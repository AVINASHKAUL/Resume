Designing and implementing Continuous Integration for SAP SHINE

SAP HANA Interactive Education (SHINE) is an Education Content to deploy, learn and develop applications from SAP HANA studio which runs on top of SAP HANA Application Services (XS Engine) with in SAP HANA Platform. SHINE enables new SAP HANA developers to quickly learn and develop applications running on top of SAP HANA Platform.

- To design Continuous Integration for SHNE application we should ensure following best practices :

  - Maintain Single Source repository
  - Automate the build.
  - Make Your Build Self-Testing.
  - Every Commit Should Build the Mainline on an Integration Machine.
  - Fix Broken Builds Immediately
  - Make it is easy for everyone to get the last executable. \* The log of each build should be available.

    Jenkins is one of the best and most used application for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery.
    Jenkins is an open source application with very active open source community constantly building new plugins and delivering new release for old versions.
    Operating System used here was Red hat Linux Server.

    For Shine we use Jenkins deployed as a Web Application Archive(war) on tomcat in Jenkins Single node distribution.
